This project is made by Tobias Skov Ludvigsen.

To run the project run a NPM start

I have used React and Redux to fetch data from https://bojwbhw97e.execute-api.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Production/eshop-challenge/products.

For styling i went with regular CSS with flex-box and classes. I did consider using bootstrap but had my focus on Redux.

It's been a intriguing challenge to work with Redux and is something i definitely will look more into. This is the first time i become acquainted with this framework and was more time consuming than I expected. Given more time i would have made a simpler react-redux app first to get a better feeling for it.

Apologies if some of the code is abit messy :)

Hope i hear from you soon
